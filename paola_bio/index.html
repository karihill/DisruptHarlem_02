Activist. Athlete. Poet. Dreamer. Do-er.</a>
</h2>
	<p> I was raised in Brooklyn, New York. My family is from Ecuador; my father traveled here when he was 22, making me a first-generation citizen.</p>
	<p> I spend most of my free time surrounded in academics; I like to read all types of novels, I read up on current events to stay updated, and I follow politics through all its branches. I found catharsis in poetry during my later years of high school and I have never looked back, though I don't write as much as I'd like to. I also found Ultimate Frisbee when I was in high school, an uncommon and little-known sport that has made me appreciate the unorthodox things in life. </p>

	<p> I have come to realize that technology, like the culinary arts and fashion, presents a dynamic platform in which to work. It is ever-expanding, presenting us with new advances and opportunities for those daring enough to continue venturing through its complexities. It has also been the reason most of humanity (with access) has been able to connect across the world, and it has helped build bridges along cultures and communities that was nearly impossible around 50 years ago. As with every new discovery in life, there are pros and cons; technology has allowed us unprecedented advances in medicine while also contributing to the mechanical components that have proved detrimental to our planet - I strive to use my knowledge from this class to supplement the good aspects of technology, however that may culminate.  </p>

	<p> In five years, I hope to have furthered my grasp in the technological field, while also having attained my masters in law (specific branch yet unknown) and using that to help make justice attainable throughout historically disadvantaged communities in which it has proven most elusive. </p>
