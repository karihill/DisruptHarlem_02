<p> I was raised in Brooklyn, New York. My family is from Ecuador; my father traveled here when he was 22, making me a first-generation citizen.</p>
  <p> I spend most of my free time surrounded in academics; I like to read all types of novels, I read up on current events to stay updated, and I follow politics through all its branches. I found catharsis in poetry during my later years of high school and I have never looked back, though I don't write as much as I'd like to. I also found Ultimate Frisbee when I was in high school, an uncommon and little-known sport that has made me appreciate the unorthodox things in life. </p>
